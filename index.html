    <!-- Here I would like to explain how you can create a profile, create your list and deadlines for when you want to do them, link to other activity sites, and check off the lists on the items when they are completed. Explain how default bucket lists are private but you can make them public to share with other users, and get fun and creative idea inspiration from other useres bucket lists. I want to really sell the app here -->

                <p>Hi, I'm Sara and this is my dog Milo. About a year ago I decided to set out on an adventure. I didn't have a plan but I needed a way to come up with one...and fast. I knew I wanted to travel and check things off my bucket list, so I joined 30 Before 30! This app made planning out me and Milo's adventure so much easier. I was able to create my profile and make my list right away. The best part...getting inspiration from all my fellow 30 Before 30 friends!</p>

                <p>With 30 Before 30 I was able to go skydiving, white water rafting, scuba diving, and of course visit amazing puppy parks for Milo. Now, I have a beautiful adventure story to share with all my friends and family. Thank you 30 Before 30 for making all of this possible!</p>
