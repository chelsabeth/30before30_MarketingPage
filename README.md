***PROPOSAL***
Q1: What problems does your app solve? 

A1: Our app makes it easy for users to create a list of goals that they would like to acheive before they turn 30. Having this list on your phone wherever you go can be helpful. Say you are on a vacation, and during that vacation you have the opportunity to do something that is on your 30 before 30 list. You can conviently check it off as you achieve your goals. 

Q2: What is the mission statement? 

A2: we are a time-boxed bucket lsit app. Everyone has goals they want to achieve at certian parts of their life and this app helps make that possible! This app is an above and beyond bucket list. Maybe you are going through a mid-life crisis or just want to achieve certain things before important milestones in our lives. Either way, this app is guarunteed to make the process easier!
